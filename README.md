# ðŸ“– Read Mode â€“ Android App

**Read Mode** is a lightweight Android app designed to improve your reading experience â€” especially on devices that **donâ€™t have a built-in Night Light or color filter** option in system settings.

## âœ¨ Features
- ðŸš« **No Ads** â€“ 100% distraction-free.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Customizable Screen Color** â€“ Choose from 6 different colors (or none) to tint your screen.
- ðŸ”§ **Adjustable Color Intensity** â€“ Fine-tune how strong the color filter is.
- ðŸ’¡ **Brightness Control** â€“ Reduce or increase screen brightness beyond system defaults.
- ðŸ“± **Works on all devices** â€“ Ideal for older phones without built-in Night Light or blue light filter.
- ðŸ†“ **Completely Free** â€“ No hidden costs or in-app purchases.

## â„¹ Technical Notes
- Android introduced the official **Night Light (blue light filter)** feature starting with **Android 9 (Pie)**. ([Google Support](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7169926?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Many devices, especially older ones or heavily customized versions of Android, still lack this functionality.
- **Read Mode** fills that gap by giving you full control over screen color and brightness directly from the app.

## ðŸ’¡ Why Use Read Mode?
Bright white screens can cause eye strain and make it harder to sleep after late-night reading. With **Read Mode**, you can:
- Reduce blue light for healthier nighttime reading.
- Customize screen color for comfort.
- Minimize eye strain during long reading sessions.
